Jason's essay eventually became the founding document of the Free State Project. In it, Jason proposed a mass migration, a voluntary resettlement of 20,000 libertarians, anarchists, anarcho-capitalists, pacifists, even freedom-minded Democrats and Republicans, to a single, relatively liberty-friendly state, where they could establish a beachhead of personal and economic freedom.

The mission and strategy of the NBFP was inspired by the NHFSP: liberate Canadians from socialist oppression by concentrating freedom-lovers in a sparsely-populated (800K) province. In 2023, the NBFP became the first and only Canadian freedom project to be listed in the Free Cities Foundation's directory of 'Free Communities' (free-communities.org).\n\nPrior to Covid, Mark had many years of experience as a rule of law activist defending Canada's Charter of Rights against abuses by police, government, media, leftist radicals and violent Native militants during a fraudulent land claim dispute in Caledonia, Ontario. He was part of a team whose work led to a 9-0 victory at the Supreme Court of Canada that defined the limits of police/government infringement of the constitution during an 'emergency.' Mark's work is cited in two books about the Caledonia crisis: the bestseller, 'Helpless: Caledonia's Nightmare of Fear And Anarchy, And How The Law Failed All Of Us,' and the near-best-seller, 'Victory In The No-Go Zone: Winning The Fight Against Two-Tier Policing.' \n\nIn September 2021, Mark released a prescient report outlining in detail the concerns about the mRNA 'vaccines' and the devastating consequences to society of using coercion to force them on citizens: 'Vaccine Hesitancy And The Risks Of Medical Segregation Discrimination Policies.'

The state's low unemployment rate and an influx of out-of-state buyers are the primary reasons for this growth. However, this market has created a limited supply for affordable homes, making them more challenging to find.

Then come to this basic class/overview of the foundation techniques. If you have them, bring those crochet hooks that have been taunting you in the corner gathering dust. If you don't have a kit, we'll have some with which to practice during the class and some others you can purchase so you can continue to practice after the class or at one of our many \"Stitch & Bitch\" gatherings throughout the week.\n\nAlternately, you can get your own yarn, hooks and/or a basic kit at the Walmart in Littleton, which is on the way to Roger's. If you're buying your own kit to bring, just:\n\n1. Select a small skein of a light colored acrylic or cotton material (easier to see the stitches than with a dark color) in a worsted or sport weight (look on the label for the yarn weight). Number 4 is best.\n\n2. Look at the yarn's label to see what size hook is recommended. You should see a picture of a hook with the size next to it. Bring that size hook or buy one if you don't have one already.\n\n3. Ask an attendant at the store for help if you're not sure what to get.\n\n4. Watch some beginner YouTube videos or buy a beginner \"How to Crochet\" book. It'll all make sense quicker if you've prepared before you come to PorcFest. \n\n5. Show up to class on Tuesday with your kit and say Hi!!!\nDescription: This is a beginner class where your fabulous instructor will teach you (or help you relearn) the basics. You will learn how to do a chain stitch and a \"single crochet\" stitch in this class.  Master these stitches and you can start making crochet hats, scarves, blankets, and the like.  See you there!\nInstructor: Kristin Alpert, Kristin learned to crochet when she was a pre-teen from her grandmother. She then let it slide while she attended Nursing school and started raising a family. In 2005, Kristin started crocheting again and found it was like riding a bike; everything came back to her! She finds it very relaxing and rewarding and especially enjoys making items which she gifts or donates to various causes.

Part of what makes this statement questionable for many Christians is that Mormons have books in addition to the Bible that are considered by Mormons to be equally scriptural.

He has flown to Montana, Philadelphia, Portland ME, and Burlington VT from Florida with a checked handgun. So far Keith as been to 17 states with a handgun. His girlfriend is weary of The Talk on crossing each state line about yet another set of gun rules. Crossing a line can go from being allowed to carry in a grocery store, to the firearm must be unloaded and locked in the safe with the ammo in a separate hard-sided locked container. Some states we can legally open carry in the national forest campgrounds and in some states we are not allowed to camp in the forest at all because we have a gun. This takes research and should not be taken lightly, as jail is a distinct possibility in the communist US states.\nKeith has a Florida CWL, an NRA Range Safety Officer (RSO) certification, and passed the classroom training, test, and range qual for the Florida Class D Security Officer and Class G Armed Security licenses. \nProfessionally, Keith is an electrical and systems engineer with 30 years experience designing communications systems for military aircraft, ships, and submarines.\nKeith hosts the Rebel Civics show on Unsafe Space, writes for UncoverDC and Liberty Block, and is Admin of the FLexit Facebook group.. <a href=\"https://rumble.com/c/UnsafeSpace\"> Website </a>. <a href=\"https://scontent-mia3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/349086324_1611822559286445_5541692000701724557_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5cd70e&_nc_ohc=Yj27thTjSNUAX_a2kKO&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-2.xx&oh=00_AfBI6ePU72tiysobAJ6jiIVU5fANGRP1qhgRSiZaYgixGw&oe=647658A9\"> Image </a>\nWhen: Tue, 1:00P _(60m)\nWhere: REBL: Rebel Civics - Unsafe Space, T50\nNote: Traveling these united states with a firearm for personal protection requires managing the risk of governments who gleefully infringe on your natural right to keep and bear arms.

This unorthodox upbringing has given Moira a unique appreciation for exploration and self-discovery that shapes her philosophy of childhood and how kids learn, and the important role of imagination and creativity.  \nMoira’s decision to become a mother was a pivotal moment in her life and, because of this, in the spring of 2016 she began to develop the concept for a new business model. By the following year, as a local initiative of her online platform, Moira started “Albany Pop-Up Adventure Playground,” a temporary play space filled with loose parts and objects designed to inspire imagination and creativity.  By the time of the plandemic, more than 700 people have attended the pop-ups, which Moira designed as an opportunity for all children to have access to child-led play in her own local community.\nIn 2023 Moira and her son London moved to Chester, Vermont where a new chapter is now unfolding.\nWhen: Wed, 8:00A _(60m)\nWhere: RV30: RV30, RV30\n<a href=\"https://linktr.ee/thelearningweb\">More Info </a>","location":"RV30","startDatetime":"2023-06-21T12:00:00Z","endDatetime":"2023-06-21T13:00:00Z","timestamp":"2023-06-05T01:05:02Z"},{"summary":"<b>Sigma Male Party</b>  [T17]","description":"For Whom: Anyone who likes to party\nDescription: Step into the world of the Sigma Male Party, where individuality reigns supreme.
