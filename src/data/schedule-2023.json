What impact will we have over the next 20 years?\nSpeaker: Jason Sorens, The Free State Project was founded in 2001 by Jason Sorens, then a Ph.D. student at Yale University. Jason was studying independence movements in other countries and thinking about how liberty-minded folk could have an impact as a small minority in the world and the U.S. Jason published an article in The Libertarian Enterprise highlighting the failure of libertarians to elect any candidate to federal office and outlining his ideas for a migration movement that continues an American tradition of political migration, which includes groups such as Mormon settlers in Utah, Amish religious communities, and the \"Jamestown Seventy\", an earlier effort to influence the politics of a particular state through deliberate migration. Jason's essay eventually became the founding document of the Free State Project. In it, Jason proposed a mass migration, a voluntary resettlement of 20,000 libertarians, anarchists, anarcho-capitalists, pacifists, even freedom-minded Democrats and Republicans, to a single, relatively liberty-friendly state, where they could establish a beachhead of personal and economic freedom.

She has also been a real estate investor since her early twenties when she rented her single family home in Ohio and moved to Alaska. She and her partner currently have 13 rental units.

Fatalities in this area are dominated by those that occur on Mount Washington, the highest peak in the range. It is notorious for its unpredictable and inclement weather, making it one of the deadliest mountains in the continental United States. Due to its unique location relative to other geographic features, it holds the world record for highest recorded surface wind speed not within a tropical cyclone.
