Jason's essay eventually became the founding document of the Free State Project. In it, Jason proposed a mass migration, a voluntary resettlement of 20,000 libertarians, anarchists, anarcho-capitalists, pacifists, even freedom-minded Democrats and Republicans, to a single, relatively liberty-friendly state, where they could establish a beachhead of personal and economic freedom.

The mission and strategy of the NBFP was inspired by the NHFSP: liberate Canadians from socialist oppression by concentrating freedom-lovers in a sparsely-populated (800K) province. In 2023, the NBFP became the first and only Canadian freedom project to be listed in the Free Cities Foundation's directory of 'Free Communities' (free-communities.org).\n\nPrior to Covid, Mark had many years of experience as a rule of law activist defending Canada's Charter of Rights against abuses by police, government, media, leftist radicals and violent Native militants during a fraudulent land claim dispute in Caledonia, Ontario. He was part of a team whose work led to a 9-0 victory at the Supreme Court of Canada that defined the limits of police/government infringement of the constitution during an 'emergency.' Mark's work is cited in two books about the Caledonia crisis: the bestseller, 'Helpless: Caledonia's Nightmare of Fear And Anarchy, And How The Law Failed All Of Us,' and the near-best-seller, 'Victory In The No-Go Zone: Winning The Fight Against Two-Tier Policing.' \n\nIn September 2021, Mark released a prescient report outlining in detail the concerns about the mRNA 'vaccines' and the devastating consequences to society of using coercion to force them on citizens: 'Vaccine Hesitancy And The Risks Of Medical Segregation Discrimination Policies.'

Jay also attended many freedom meetings and law study groups like one put on By the John Birch society.    As a teenager Jay worked or apprenticed in many trades that include, HVAC, logging, auto and equipment repair, roofing, welding, blacksmithing, farrier, feed broker, hay stacker and all around farm hand.     Jay was a hay dealer and horse trader until 2013, then he moved to Colorado to work on a 3500 acre crop farm, a large commercial dairy operation, and a harvest crew, that was Owned buy his Mom Karen and Stepfather Trent. \n\nThen he moved to New Hampshire in late 2016 to join the FreeStateproject.org.  Jay met his wife Shalon at the Porcupine Freedom Festival (Porcfest) in 2014, they got Married at Porcfest in 2018 bought a home with some land, has 2 kids and started raising cows, pigs and chickens and preparing generation next to not need government.

What children do to get their dopamine hits before 7 years old, is what will give them their dopamine hit for the rest of their lives. \n\nInternet Devices, create a reward mechanism, via easy to obtain dopamine hits, creating dopamine loops resulting in stimulating the addiction lobe of the brain. \n\nMost of the young people who grew up on an internet device (ID) have no interest in, doing physical labor; or work in general, and have a very short attention span. Jay has observed an epidemic of anxiety; fits of rage; an inability to use logic and reasoning; low confidence; and a very high risk of a life time of health issues, in the modern man. This is not only the observation of myself and others, but the conclusion of many scientific studies. \n\n By understanding the effects of ID on the developing brain, from an infant to a hormone charged teenager and how ID manipulates said brain development. Jay will explain how the brain gets rewired or programmed by children using ID. Resulting in a life time struggle to engage in logic and reasoning, and a culture arising where critical thinking is replaced with fits of rage and out burst.  (A side note, every now and then someone totally freaks out, and calls me out as wrong, when I talk about the dangers of ID) \n\nJay will explain how ID and public schools are programming the sexual desires in children and teens, resulting in, the gender dysphoria issue, the lack of attraction Men and Woman are having to the opposite sex. Resulting in, the most childless women over 35 years old in history; creating the hook up culture epidemic; the destruction of the nuclear family; and finally population decline in areas of the world where high speed internet service has been around the longest. \n\nFor generations now muggle Westernairs have been letting public school indoctrinate their, kids as early as 6 years old. For over 20 years now muggle Westernaire have used internet devices to babysit and pacify their babies starting a few months old .  Jay will provide some solutions, and use the examples of what he is doing with his own kids. \n\nThe people who own the world are engaged in a conspiracy, with governments, big tech, big Pharma, the banksters, the teacher unions and the friends of Jeffery Epstein, to make our posterity a dependent class of degenerate, algorithmic slaves.\n\n  The algorithm is the perfect slave master, if it can program our posterity during brain development, the slave will never know it is a slave, just like the chicken doesn't care that it is property of the farmer, because the farmers gives the chicken all it needs to be happy. \n href=\"https://odysee.com/@FreeTalkLive:d/2023-06-01:7\">More Info </a>","location":"101","startDatetime":"2023-06-24T20:00:00Z","endDatetime":"2023-06-24T21:00:00Z","timestamp":"2023-06-13T12:24:05Z"},{"summary":"<b>Bank Run Now: Halt CBDC, Stop WW3, End the Fed</b> Aaron Day [101]","description":"For Whom: Anyone concerned about the collapse US dollar/banking system, interested in the breathtaking speed of the global rollout of CBDCs and the surveillance state who wants to take control of their own financial sovereignty and halt the spread of global tyranny without having to rely on corrupt politicians or the ballot box.

By the time of the plandemic, more than 700 people have attended the pop-ups, which Moira designed as an opportunity for all children to have access to child-led play in her own local community.\nIn 2023 Moira and her son London moved to Chester, Vermont where a new chapter in their life is now unfolding..  href=\"https://linktr.ee/thelearningweb\"> Website </a>\nWhen: Wed, 8:00A _(45m)\nWhere: ET: Enjoy Today!, RV30\n href=\"https://linktr.ee/thelearningweb\">More Info </a>","location":"ET","startDatetime":"2023-06-21T12:00:00Z","endDatetime":"2023-06-21T12:45:00Z","timestamp":"2023-06-13T12:24:05Z"},{"summary":"<b>Cajun Shrimp Boil Signup</b> Carolyn Urbanski [ET]","description":"For Whom: Hungry friends who enjoy a friendly Cajun feast!

This meet up is introverts only, no extroverts. This gives us a chance to socialize with people who get it. No pressure. \n\nThe rule will be that if you want to stop socializing at any moment, you can walk away, whether it's from a single person, a group of people, or the whole event. Whether it's mid conversation or mid awkward pause. Don't worry, we get it.\nHost: Gaby Galvan, Gaby is a mega introvert. She loves spending her days alone at home being creative but also just watching TV (she watches too much honestly). She's also anti-social and might not even show up to this thing (lol). Jk, she'll definitely be there, and then she'll immediately run to the introvert's corner right after to recharge.
